Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

  1. Reusing cells across the apps
  2. More info about the new containtment view controllers and what are the drawbacks of using that vs custom container view controller
